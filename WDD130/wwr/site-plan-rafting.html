    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>[We provide experiences for all ages and types of thrill seekers. We provide floats for everyone one from the young family to the adrenaline junkie. We are a locally owned and operated company working with guides making up over 40years of experience. Our staff provide first class lunches for all floats over 4 hours to make sure that everyone is happy and energized to take on the next section of water. On our rafts we have multiple 360 cameras that capture your float that you can download once you are done. We also work with teams of photographers / videographers to help capture your unforgettable moments that live on forever. You can see our highlights reels on YouTube and the group with the top voted video each month gets a free trip.]</p>
    
    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>[Our key demographic is people 16-40 with an expendable income that would allow multiple trips a year. The best clients would be D.I.N.K Dual Income No Kids these households pay for more and more experiences and have the extra income to allow for that. They often do more things in groups of friends with similar interests who then also refer other people. They are also more often on social media that provide free advertising by sharing their trip videos and photos. We are seeing more and more people are paying for experiences that they can share with family and friends on social media. Social media cross platform sites with be key to getting to our company business and brand recognition.]</p>
